                <p class="col-8">My favourite city is The Maldives. It is currently on my bucket list of holiday
                    destinations.
                    The Maldives is a tropical holiday destination in the Indian Ocean.
                    The stunning islands are very relaxed and offer an experience which can best be described as a
                    getaway
                    on a desert island but with high quality accommodation, spectacular food, excellent service and an
                    extensive range of activities.
                    The other reason it is on my bucket list is because the accommodation that I love the most there,
                    just
                    challenges one to be the best swimmer because it is basically in the island as can be seen in the
                    picture.

                I would like to learn Mandarin because China is far ahead with Technology.
                I would like to do business with China and it will be great not to have language as a barrier.

                            business I would like to pursue and I believe it equipped me well.
                            I learnt the basic skills and concepts needed to run an organization.
                            By fully comprehending how a business operates, you have a better idea of how different
                            business functions relate and how your decisions impact the organization as a whole.

                        <p class="col-4">This is what I learnt from this module - Information Technology management
                            basically refers to monitoring and administration of an organization's information
                            technology systems: hardware, software and networks.
                            IT management focuses on how to make information systems operate effectively and
                            efficiently.

                        <p class="col-4">What I learnt from this subject was that Project Managers are responsible
                            for planning, organizing, and directing the completion of specific projects for an
                            organization while ensuring these projects are on
                            time,on budget, and within scope.
                            I also learnt that this does not only help organizations but also individuals to
                            organize themselves in self management.
