            <p>My favourite city is The Maldives. It is currently on my bucket list of holiday destinations.
                The Maldives is a tropical holiday destination in the Indian Ocean.
                The stunning islands are very relaxed and offer an experience which can best be described as a getaway
                on a desert island but with high quality accommodation, spectacular food, excellent service and an
                extensive range of activities.
                The other reason it is on my bucket list is because the accommodation that I love the most there, just
                challenges one to be the best swimmer because it is basically in the island as can be seen in the
                picture.

        <p>The foreign language that I would love to learn is Mandarin.
            I would like to learn Mandarin because China is far ahead with Technology.
            I would like to do business with China and it will be great not to have language as a barrier.

                <div class="subs">
                    <p>Business Fundamentals was my favourite subject because there is a techological business I would
                        like to pursue.
                        I learnt the basic skills and concepts needed to run an organization.
                        By fully comprehending how a business operates, you have a better idea of how different business
                        functions relate and
                        how your decisions impact the organization as a whole.

                <div class="subs reverse">
                    <p>This is what I learnt from this module - Information Technology management refers basically to
                        monitoring and administration
                        of an organization's information technology systems: hardware, software and networks.
                        IT management focuses on how to make information systems operate effectively and efficiently.

                <h3>Project Management</h3>
                <div class="subs">
                    <p>What I learnt from this subject was that Project Managers are responsible for planning,
                        organizing, and directing the
                        completion of specific projects for an organization while ensuring these projects are on time,
                        on budget, and within scope.
                        I also learnt that this does not only help organizations but also individuals to organize
                        themselves in self management.
